1) start zookeeper:
zookeeper-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties

2) once 1) is done, start kafka server:
kafka-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties
/usr/local/bin/kafka-server-start is where it lives i think

3) the seconbd article uses commands like not how you do. 
$ kafka-topics --list --zookeeper localhost:2181

rather than like kafka_2.11-1.1.0 bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper

it gets the things from /usr/local/bin if you ever want to snoop around

3) create a topic like this
kafka-topics --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic kerryCreatesATopic

then you can check the topics like this and it'll print out
kafka-topics --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
