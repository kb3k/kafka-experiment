1) start zookeeper:
zookeeper-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties

2) once 1) is done, start kafka server:
kafka-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties
/usr/local/bin/kafka-server-start is where it lives i think

3) the seconbd article uses commands like not how you do. 
$ kafka-topics --list --zookeeper localhost:2181

rather than like kafka_2.11-1.1.0 bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper

it gets the things from /usr/local/bin if you ever want to snoop around

3) create a topic like this
kafka-topics --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic kerryCreatesATopic

then you can check the topics like this and it'll print out
kafka-topics --list --zookeeper localhost:2181

3b) kafka-console-producer --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic kerryCreatesATopic

looks like this is actually better :
kafka-console-producer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic kerryCreatesATopic

bc broker list is deprecated

4) found log dir in cat /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties 
it is /usr/local/var/lib/kafka-logs

kafka-run-class kafka.tools.DumpLogSegments --deep-iteration --print-data-log --files /usr/local/var/lib/kafka-logs/kerryCreatesATopic-0/00000000000000000000.log

5) kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic kerryCreatesATopic --from-beginning

idk how to get it to work without the --from-beginning; how to communicate a 'latest' msg

6) changed advertised listeners in the properties file the path is a few lines up
copy and pasted some code
run it with : python3 producer_raw_recipes.py
it doesn't do much. bc the BeautifulSoup select probably.
wrote the html to a file to see what I could work with since end goal is a list of links
it broke bc beautiful soup but I fixed it I think
now it's stuck on publishing recipe part 

tried it with same input I think as the tutorial
all_recipes = ["https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/20762/california-coleslaw/", "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8584/holiday-chicken-salad/", "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/80867/cran-broccoli-salad/"]

and still died. errors:
Exception in publishing message
KafkaTimeoutError: Failed to update metadata after 60.0 secs.

next steps : figure out what a message needs to be published and give it that rather than whatever this list is. is it html it needs? do I need to switch back to the other soup thing. 
html = r.text
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'lxml')
links = soup.select('.fixed-recipe-card__h3 a')
